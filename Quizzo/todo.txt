List under map that you can search and see data  in tabulate
On mobile you can swap from just map or list viewport
Click point filters list to highlight that option
On mobile (and maybe both) clicking point just has panel on bottom with info not popup
filter for weekday, prize, event
slider for time start
also show yelp rating and num of reviews, maybe other stuff like hours
Search bar in map that looks at data from csv fields if not geocode
